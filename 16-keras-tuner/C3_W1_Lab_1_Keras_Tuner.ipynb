        "Developing machine learning models is usually an iterative process. You start with an initial design then reconfigure until you get a model that can be trained efficiently in terms of time and compute resources. As you may already know, these settings that you adjust are called _hyperparameters_. These are the variables that govern the training process and the topology of an ML model. These remain constant over the training process and directly impact the performance of your ML program.\n",
        "\n",
        "The process of finding the optimal set of hyperparameters is called *hyperparameter tuning* or *hypertuning*, and it is an essential part of a machine learning pipeline. Without it, you might end up with a model that has unnecessary parameters and take too long to train.\n",
        "\n",
        "Hyperparameters are of two types:\n",
        "1. *Model hyperparameters* which influence model selection such as the number and width of hidden layers\n",
        "\n",
        "2. *Algorithm hyperparameters* which influence the speed and quality of the learning algorithm such as the learning rate for Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and the number of nearest neighbors for a k Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier.\n",
        "\n",
        "For more complex models, the number of hyperparameters can increase dramatically and tuning them manually can be quite challenging.\n",

        "In this lab, you will practice hyperparameter tuning with [Keras Tuner](https://keras-team.github.io/keras-tuner/), a package from the Keras team that automates this process. For comparison, you will first train a baseline model with pre-selected hyperparameters, then redo the process with tuned hyperparameters. Some of the examples and discussions here are taken from the [official tutorial provided by Tensorflow](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/docs/blob/master/site/en/tutorials/keras/keras_tuner.ipynb#scrollTo=sKwLOzKpFGAj) but we've expounded on a few key parts for clarity.\n",
